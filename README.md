# Twitch PyBot
A bot scripted in Python for use on personal twitch channels.

# Setup and Documentation
This project is still in it's infancy. Everything you need is the bot.py, config.xml, and minimal knowledge of editing and handling .xml files. If you wan't to add features you'll need to know how to program things in Python. As of now there is no documentation.
